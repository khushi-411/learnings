# Representing and Manipulating Information

- Binary values work better when building machines that store and process information.
- Two-value signal (binary digits or bits) are readily represented, transmitted, and stored.
- Using standard character code we encode the letters and symbols in a document.
- This chapter covers this encoding and encoding for negative numbers and to approximate real numbers.
- Encodings are Unsigned encodings, Signed integers encodings, and Floating-point encodings.
- Computer representations use a limited number of bits to encode a number, hence sometimes operations overflow.
- Integer computer arithmetic satisfies many properties of the true integer arithmetic.
- Floating-point number does not necessary statisfy it, like overflow will yield `+âˆž`, it's not associative.
- Floating-point has wide range, unlike integer, but are just approximate, unlike integer who are accurate.
- How to perform arithmetic operations by directly manipulating bit-level representations of numbers?
    - Requires understanding of mahine-level code generated by compilers in attempt to optimize the performance.
